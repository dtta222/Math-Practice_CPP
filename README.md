# Math-Practice
/*
 * Project: Math Practice
 * Purpose: this program can be used as a math tutor for a young student.
 *          it repeatedly allows the user to practice solving Multiplication questions untill the user inputs "5" to stop
 *          when the practice for the user stops, this program generates the report:
 *          (1) the list of questions with correct answers which the user has practiced;
 *          (2) the total number of questions the user has solved;
 *          (3) the total number of mistakes the user has made;
 *          (4) display either "Great job!"(if (2) > (3)) or "You will do better next time..." (otherwise)
 *          it then quits the program.
